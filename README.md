<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Since the Covid-19 crisis, we have been using instant messaging applications such as Discord
and Slack more frequently. We might have toxic encounters on those platforms. The goal of this project is to provide
an API to assess the toxicity in a sentence. As an example, a Discord bot was also created to consume the API.

### Bot Example

### Built With
Azure was used for the CI/CD (Azure Pipelines), and it was also used to host the API using Azure Functions.
The API was written in TypeScript using nodejs. The toxicity API was built using Tensorflow and their prebuilt models.
